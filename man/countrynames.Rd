\details{
This is the UN's \emph{Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical
Use}, also known as the M49 standard
(https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49), with the following
revisions:
\itemize{
\item "State of Palestine" is replaced with "Occupied Palestinian
Territory" in accordance with the IOM \emph{House Style Manual} (May 2023).
\item "Kosovo (SCR 1244)" is added with ISO codes "XK" and "XKX".
References to Kosovo shall be understood to be in the context of United
Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).
\item "Channel Islands" is added with M49 code 830 and ISO codes "XC" and
"XCX". The Channel Islands comprise the British crown dependencies of
Guernsey and Jersey, which are present in the table. However, some
datasets (such as UN DESA's international migrant stocks) combine
Guernsey and Jersey under the Channel Islands, so the separate entry
accounts for such cases.
\item "Abyei" is added with ISO-3 code "AB9". This follows the
designations of the IDMC, whose data separately identify this disputed
area on the border between Sudan and South Sudan.
\item "Taiwan Province of China, China" is added with M49 code 158 and
ISO-3 code "TWN".
\item "Stateless" is added with ISO-3 code "STL".
\item "Unknown" is added with M49 code 2003 and ISO-3 code "OOO".
\item "Unidentified Sub-Saharan Africa" is added with ISO-3 code "OOS".
This designation appears in Frontex irregular migrants data.
\item Additional groupings are added to indicate membership in the
European Union (\code{eu}), the Schengen Area (\code{schengen}), and the Balkans
(\code{balkans}).
